# c-plus-plus-telephone-directory-project

A telephone directory project with a main menu providing options for selection to the user. The program also exports new users that are added in the directory to a "teldir.txt" file that is created in the project's directory. Can also delete users from the file, as the program reads it every time it starts. Initially, the txt file does not exist. It will be created automatically after adding the first subscriber to the directory.

This program was created as part of the coursework of my Data Structures course.

This program was coded in the XCode environment using C++.
